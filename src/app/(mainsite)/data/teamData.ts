        description: `I am a retired Captain of the Bartow County Sheriff's Office with 34.5 years of law enforcement experience. During my tenure as a law enforcement officer, I have seen the effects that drugs, alcohol, and other readily available substances have on the human body, their financial status, their families, their communities, and their lives.
        
I have always tried to do the right thing and help people when they were at their lowest, to pick them up and let them know there's a brighter day coming. I've tried to bring awareness about the effects drugs, alcohol, and other harmful substances have on the human body and how it affects the mind.
        
With my experience, training, knowledge, and the leadership of Jesus Christ and Cartersville Outreach Ministries, I believe we can impact many lives of men, transforming them, restoring them, and rebuilding them into the men they could be.`
